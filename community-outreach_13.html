                We welcome proposals from data center communities that reduce carbon emissions in
                the immediate region, including projects that increase the renewable energy mix
                powering our data centers. Applicants can be nonprofit or for-profit entrepreneurs.
                We’ll be looking for cost of generation, innovation, and total carbon reduction.
                You can submit proposals via email to <a href=
                "mailto:thedalles@google.com">thedalles@google.com</a>.
