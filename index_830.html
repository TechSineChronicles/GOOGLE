                "According to Michael Patton, the deputy director of water and waste water
                operations for the WSA, Google’s setup does indeed remove a significant burden from
                the county’s natural water supply. Google turned on its treatment center on in
                December 2008, Patton says, and the following summer—peak water season—there was an
                enormous drop in consumption across the system. ‘It’s a win-win for both us,’
                Patton tells Wired, ‘and for the community too.'"
