            its data centre in Oklahoma, USA…Google’s announcement shows what the most

            “According to Michael Patton, the deputy director of water and waste water operations
            for the WSA, Google’s setup does indeed remove a significant burden from the county’s
            natural water supply. Google turned on its treatment center on in December 2008, Patton
            says, and the following summer — peak water season — there was an enormous drop in
            consumption across the system. ‘It’s a win-win for both us,’ Patton tells Wired, ‘and
            for the community too.’”<br>

            grids. It’s hacking the regulators. The company has cooked up a plan with North
            Carolina’s Duke Energy that will let companies like Google pay for cleaner energy —
            something that’s surprisingly tricky to do thanks to the regulatory restrictions in
