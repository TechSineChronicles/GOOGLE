          <p>
            Google hires the most qualified individuals from around the world. We make it a
            priority to hire from the local community whenever possible because it‘s good for
            business and the right thing to do. <a href=
            "//www.google.com/about/careers/search/#t=sq&amp;q=j&amp;jl=33.19600,-80.01313&amp;jc=DATA_CENTER_OPERATIONS"
            target="_blank">Learn more about our data center jobs and find available positions</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also seek to contract with local vendors whenever possible. While all of our
            contracting needs are currently met, we’re happy to consider any vendor inquiries.
            Please send all inquiries to <a href=
            "mailto:berkeleycounty-construction@google.com">berkeleycounty-construction@google.com</a>
            for further review. In addition, we contract with our vendor G4S for security at all
            our facilities. Frequently, G4S hires regionally for open positions on <a href=
            "http://www.g4s.us/en-US/Careers/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">their website</a>.

          life at the Berkeley County data center.

              Neal Menkus, Hardware Operations
            </h3>
            <p>
              As part of Google's security plan, when we remove a storage drive from the data
              center floor, we send it to a team that includes Neal Menkus. Inside the data
              security cage (which includes the bright storage lockers you see here), Neal and
              other workers use special equipment to completely erase all of the data. After
              erasing the failed drive, we physically destroy it an industrial shredder—one of his
              favorite jobs.
            </p>
            <p>
              When Neal's friends ask him what he does for a living, he answers, “Imagine you walk
              into a large warehouse and there's nothing there except aisles of computer
              motherboards, thousands of them, stacked on top of each other in racks the size of
              refrigerators.” Then he asks his friends to think about how often they have a problem
              with their computer at home. “The same things happen to our servers, and guess who
              gets to fix them?”

              Some of our employees with military backgrounds

            <p>
              <em>From right to left: Sara Sutherland, Jeff Stevenson, Ryan Kinowski, Paul Gorsky,

            </p>
            <p>
              These five Google employees have something else in common: they have all, at one
              point, served in the U.S. Military. With past roles in the Navy and Coast Guard as
              electricians, submarine officers, electronics technicians, and mechanics, these
              Googlers now work together at the Berkeley County facility where their previous
              military experience comes in handy. "In the Navy, you had to learn really quickly and
              work with integrated systems," says Ryan. "That's still the case today."
            </p>
            <p>
              Sara, who had once operated a nuclear power plant, now uses her expertise to ensure
              that the data center is a safe place to work. "We work with critical systems, and
              there are a lot of parameters to monitor at once. We've had to build health and
              safety procedures from scratch, and my experience in emergency response has helped me
              do that."
