            <p>
              You’ve heard about Midwesterners. That we’re hard workers and form tight-knit
              communities. That we have integrity and say “pop” instead of “soda.” At Google Ann
              Arbor, it’s all true – plus, we get the chance to do some of the coolest work around,
              and have tons of fun doing it.
            </p>
            <p>
              We’re a sales office. We help companies, large and small, to use digital advertising.
              We advise them on how to use our ad products, from AdWords to Analytics to Mobile.
              Mostly though, we help them to get new customers and <a href=

            </p>
            <p>
              We’re in downtown Ann Arbor, a culturally vibrant city home to the University of
              Michigan and a thriving tech scene. We have all the usual Googley features –
              whimsical décor, weekly TGIF parties, awesome off-sites – but are small enough that
              we all know each other. So collaboration is easy, and when we have a good idea we can
              make it into a reality in a hurry.

            Google Ann Arbor: Frequently Asked Questions

          <h4 class="twisty">
            What’s your day-to-day work like at Google Ann Arbor?
          </h4>
          <p>
            Relationships are a huge part of what we do. We work in small teams, and we genuinely
            like each other – so many of our Googlers develop great, long-lasting friendships. We
            also spend a lot of time getting to know our clients, their businesses and what is
            important to them. While that means we spend a lot of time emailing and making phone
            calls, it also gives us opportunities to travel all over North America. We’re also
            responsible for representing Google to people across the country. We learn Google’s ins
            and outs so we can find the right solutions to help businesses grow by using our
            products.
          </p>
          <h4 class="twisty">
            What types of businesses do you work with at Google Ann Arbor?
          </h4>
          <p>
            Don’t let our proximity to Detroit lead you astray - while we do a lot of work with the
            automotive industry, we have Googlers involved in just about every type of business you
            can imagine. From Fortune 500 companies to small, family-owned businesses, from B2B and
            retail to governments and <a href=
            "https://plus.google.com/u/1/105912973864602608032/posts?gpsrc=hpjob">nonprofits</a>,
            we have opportunities for Googlers to work with a huge range of companies across the
            country.
          </p>
          <h4 class="twisty">
            What’s Google Ann Arbor most proud of?
          </h4>
          <p>
            Probably the many ways we work with surrounding communities. We started a program to
            teach high school and college students about online marketing; today it’s used across
            the country. Once a week, we hold community office hours, during which local businesses
            and nonprofits can come to the office and learn how to get more out of online tools. We
            also started a very successful program called Accelerate with Google, an effort to help
            educate emerging businesses on Google tools to help them better connect with their
            target audiences online. The project was started by two of our Googlers with a passion
            for diversity. After attending a conference for African-American entrepreneurs, these
            Googlers realized that many emerging business owners weren't aware of the online tools
            available to them to help them grow and advertise their businesses. They saw an
            opportunity for Google to help this community, and two years later, Accelerate with
            Google has evolved into a team of 40+ volunteer Googlers working to drive acquisition,
            development, partnerships and retention within underrepresented emerging business
            communities.
          </p>
          <h4 class="twisty">
            Do you help the community via volunteering and philanthropy?
          </h4>
          <p>
            We’re passionate about getting involved in our community through volunteering. A lot of
            us help the local 826 Michigan literacy organization, which is right down the street.
            The 826 Ann Arbor chapter features a robot-themed store, making it a perfect fit with
            Google. We go to the local veterans hospital to play bingo with the patients. We paddle
            out in canoes to clean up the Huron River. And we help students in Detroit improve
            their job prospects by writing stronger resumes.
          </p>
          <h4 class="twisty">
            What do you do for fun?
          </h4>
          <div>
            <p>
              Ann Arbor is a funky town, and we take advantage of it. We’ve rented local theaters
              to screen movies, invited a local ice cream shop into the office and gone on a
              scavenger hunt with clues hidden across Ann Arbor. We’re less than an hour from
              Detroit, so it’s easy to head to the city for Lions or Tigers games. If boating or
              beaches are more your speed, you have your choice of Great Lakes for weekend
              getaways.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our Googlers have organized a bunch of sports teams, from volleyball to softball. And
              we have amazing team off-sites, like the one where we went to a hoe-down and our
              managers dressed up like cowpokes. Our managers also dress up in black tie to serve
              us breakfast at our annual office anniversary celebration. Apparently they seek out
              opportunities to look ridiculous.

          <h4 class="twisty">
            What else do you like about Google Ann Arbor?
          </h4>
          <p>
            Being in Ann Arbor. It has all of the culture of a large city, without all of the
            hassles. It’s full of smart, creative people and great bars and restaurants (we’re big
            fans of Zingerman’s Deli and the award-winning local microbreweries). As the name might
            suggest, Ann Arbor is filled with trees, leading to a very green, environmentally
            conscious city. There’s always something interesting happening somewhere, from art
            fairs and theatre to performances by the Chicago and San Francisco Symphonies. And
            compared to a lot of places, it’s really easy to get around – and really affordable.
