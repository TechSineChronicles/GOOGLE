                In 2010, Google and electric company Santee Cooper announced the Berkeley Green

                greenhouse gas emissions generated by the county landfill. Google will purchase all
                of the carbon offsets created by this project through 2013.

                We welcome proposals from data center communities that reduce carbon emissions in
                the immediate region, including projects that increase the renewable energy mix
                powering our data centers. Applicants can be nonprofit or for-profit entrepreneurs.
