          Google hires the most qualified individuals from around the world. We don’t know in
          advance how many people we will hire locally, but we make it a priority to hire from

          to do.

          Due to the large number of applications we receive daily, we cannot accept resumes that
          are not for a specific position or location. Also, it may take us several months to
          follow-up with an applicant, so please be patient.
