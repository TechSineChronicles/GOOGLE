              <p>
                Google is also committed to creating a better web that's better for the
                environment. For example, we take a unique approach to water conservation at the
                Douglas County data center. Through our <a href=
                "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJnlgM1yEU0" target="_blank">reuse water
                system</a>, we use recycled water for 100% of our cooling needs. The system
                intercepts water coming from the nearby WSA treatment plant. Water that would have
                gone to the Chattahoochee River instead goes to the Google-funded Sweetwater Creek
                Sidestream Plant where it is cleaned enough to be used in our data center cooling
                infrastructure. Any water that doesn’t evaporate during the cooling process is sent
                to an effluent treatment plant on the data center property, where it is treated and
                returned to the river clean, clear and safe. We recently received an E3 award in
                the "Sustainable water solutions" category from the Metro Atlanta Chamber of
                Commerce for this effort.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to our on-site composting and recycling efforts, our employees maintain
                a community garden from which we donate crops to the Atlanta Community Food Bank.
              </p>
              <p>
                We welcome proposals from data center communities that reduce carbon emissions in
                the immediate region, including projects that increase the renewable energy mix
                powering our data centers. Applicants can be nonprofit or for-profit entrepreneurs.
                We’ll be looking for cost of generation, innovation, and total carbon reduction.
