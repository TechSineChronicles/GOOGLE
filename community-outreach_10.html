          In the community
        </h2>
        <p>
          At Google, we’re committed to playing a positive role in each of the communities in which
          we operate around the world. Through grant-making and local initiatives, we're working to
          help businesses, schools, and nonprofits thrive. We're always seeking opportunities for
          Googlers to share their time and expertise with the local community.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Community partnerships
        </h3>
        <p>
          In March 2012, we signed a partnership with the <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.mundaneum.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by BackStreet browser, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Project.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.mundaneum.org/'"
          target="_blank">Mundaneum</a>, a museum in Mons which celebrates two unique Belgian
          inventors and pioneers, Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine. We’re sponsoring the current
          exhibition at the Mundaneum headquarters in Mons, as well as a speaker series on Internet
          issues with the Mundaneum and our mutual partner, the University of Ghent. We’ll be
          engaging in other local partnerships over the coming months and years.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Educational outreach
        </h3>
        <p>
          To fulfill our goal of hiring locally, we are working with local high schools, colleges
          and universities to help them develop and enhance their technology programs. In doing so,
          we hope to help grow the members of the community who are just entering the workforce,
          re-training, or progressing in their career paths. We want to help invigorate
          participation and opportunity in technology, increase knowledge in the community, and
          benefit potential employers in the area in the future.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Green initiatives
        </h3>
        <p>
          We are also committed to creating a better web that's better for the environment. We
          welcome proposals from data center communities that reduce carbon emissions in the
          immediate region, including projects that increase the renewable energy mix powering our
          data centers. Applicants can be nonprofit or for-profit entrepreneurs. We’ll be looking
          for cost of generation, innovation, and total carbon reduction. To submit proposals,
          please contact <a href="mailto:stghislain@google.com">stghislain@google.com</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Community grants
        </h3>
        <p>
          Google provides community grants to local NGOs for projects that focus on:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Boosting science and technology education.
          </li>
          <li>Improving the environment, with an emphasis on reducing carbon in the atmosphere
          through conservation and renewable energy.
          </li>
          <li>Bringing local culture online.
          </li>
          <li>Providing access to the Internet.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The grants are one-time. We aim to support building new, lasting capacity for an
          organization and expect the activities to continue into the future without additional
          funding. When evaluating proposals, we consider:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Economic impact on the data center community or surrounding area.
          </li>
          <li>Measurable goals.
          </li>
          <li>Collaboration with other organizations and the ability to leverage other resources in
          the community.
          </li>
          <li>Integration of Google in-kind or volunteer resources to maximize the impact.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Google community grants range from $5,000 to $50,000, and are intended for nonprofit and
          certain public organizations. We will not fund for-profit companies through this program.
          If you believe you have a project or program that fits these guidelines, please register
          and submit your proposal through our <a href=
          "https://googlegiving.eresources.com/app/stg/login.asp" target="_blank">online
          application</a>.
