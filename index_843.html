              <h2>
                Piloting new technology
              </h2>
              <p>
                One of the ways we support the development of new technologies is by piloting them
                on our own turf—putting our campuses on the cutting edge of renewable energy use.
                We’ve tried new renewable energy options that help our operations run more
                efficiently while helping these technologies evolve and scale more rapidly.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to our 1.9 MW solar array, we've incorporated other forms of renewable
                energy into our corporate campuses. This includes running a 970 kW <a href=
                "//www.google.com/#q=cogeneration" target="_blank">cogeneration unit</a> off our
                local landfill gas, which not only removes the <a href=
                "//www.google.com/#q=methane" target="_blank">methane</a>, a particularly potent
                greenhouse gas, but converts it into electricity and heat that we use on campus.
                We've also installed an efficient <a href=
                "//www.google.com/#q=geothermal+heat+pump" target="_blank">ground source heat
                pump</a> and deployed solar water heating on our office buildings in Mountain View,
                Hyderabad, and Tel Aviv.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Criteria for bringing new technologies on campus
              </h3>
              <h4>
                They make good business sense.
              </h4>
              <p>
                In other words, we are confident that the technology will deliver a return on
                investment (ROI) in a reasonable period of time. For example, the 1.7 MW solar
                installation we implemented in 2007 produces over 3,000,000 kWh of clean energy per
                year, saving us a great deal in energy costs and reducing our carbon footprint.
              </p>
              <h4>
                They have long term potential to transform the industry.
              </h4>
              <p>
                We believe that by putting our dollars and resources behind a promising new
                technology—or allowing companies to use our campus as a testing ground—the
                technology will have a better chance of making it to market and scaling. For
                example, in 2007, we hosted the first installation of a promising new fuel cell
                technology that has the potential to use biogas. The company, also based in the Bay
                Area, was able to more quickly evolve the technology by having a working real-world
                pilot nearby.

                Purchasing clean energy
              </h2>
              <p>
                Where possible, Google powers its operations with renewable power by buying this
                energy directly from our utility providers and from green energy facilities in the
                same grid regions as our data centers. By signing long term contracts for this
                power, Google provides the utilities and developers financial certainty, which
                removes a significant roadblock to building renewable facilities and expands the
                amount of renewable energy on the grid. We've now signed nine contracts for 1,146
                MW of wind energy, which is enough to power over 330,000 U.S. households. This is
                an important step toward our long-term goal of powering our operations with 100%
                renewable energy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, we hold ourselves to the highest standards when purchasing
                renewables. Our contracts meet strict criteria to ensure that our purchases are of
                the highest quality. First, they create new sources of green power on the grid.
                Second, the renewable attributes from the agreements are applied to our power
                consumption in the same year the energy is generated. And third, we purchase an
                equal quantity of energy and green attributes at the same time. The details of our
                renewable Power Purchase Agreement strategy are publicly available to provide a
                blueprint for other companies to green their operations and the grid.

                The power we purchase via these contracts is incorporated into the regional power

                We’ve also been working closely with our utility partners to find ways to source
                renewables directly. In September 2012, we signed <a href=
