<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<div class="maia-promo">
<p>This is an archived version of our Privacy Policy. View the <a href="index_30.html">current version</a> or <a href="index_71.html">all past versions</a>.</div>
<p>Google respects and protects the privacy of the individuals that use Google’s search engine services (“Google Search Services”). Individually identifiable information about you is not willfully disclosed to to any third party without first receiving your permission, as explained in this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”).
<h2>Google and Cookies</h2>
<p>Upon your first visit to Google, Google sends a “cookie” to your computer. A cookie is a file that identifies you as a unique user. Google uses cookies to track user trends and patterns to better understand our user base and to improve the quality of our service. Google may also choose to use cookies to store user preferences. A cookie can tell us, “This is the same computer that visited Google two days ago,” but it cannot tell us, “This person is Joe Smith” or even, “This person lives in the United States.”
<p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Be aware, however, that some parts of the Google Search Service may not function properly if you refuse cookies.
<h2>What Information Do We Collect?</h2>
<p>From time to time we may request that you provide us with certain personal information about you in connection with various services offered on our site. Google does not collect any personal information about you (such as your name, email address, etc.) except when you specifically and knowingly provide such information.
<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
<p>The sites displayed as search results or linked to by Google Search Services are developed by people over whom Google exercises no control. Other links, such as those for the Google-friends mailing list archive, are also on sites not controlled by Google. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. Google may choose to exhibit its search results in the form of a “URL redirecter.” When Google uses a URL redirecter, if you click on a URL from a search result, information about the click is sent to Google, and Google in turn sends you to the site you clicked on. Google uses this URL information to understand and improve the quality of Google’s search technology. For instance, Google uses this information to determine how often users are satisfied with the first result of a query and how often they proceed to later results.
<h2>With Whom Does Google Share Information?</h2>
<p>Google may share information about you with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. However, we only divulge aggregate information about our users and will not share personally identifiable information with any third party without your express consent. For example, we may disclose how frequently the average Google user visits Google, or which other query words are most often used with the query word “Linux.” Please be aware, however, that we will release specific personal information about you if required to do so in order to comply with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order.
<h2>Your consent and changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>By using the Google Search Services and our web site, you consent to the collection and use of your information as we have outlined in this policy and to our <a href="index_49.html">Terms of Service Policy</a>. Google may decide to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
<h2>Who can I ask if I have additional questions?</h2>
<p>Feel free to contact us any time and we’ll answer any additional questions you may have. Our email address is <a href="mailto:help@google.com">help@google.com</a>.</div></div></div>
