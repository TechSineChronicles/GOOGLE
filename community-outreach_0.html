                Google is also committed to creating a better web that's better for the
                environment. In 2007, we made a voluntary commitment to become carbon neutral. To
                meet our goal, we travel around the world searching for green projects and are
                proud to take part in green initiatives in North Carolina. Our projects here
                include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>A pilot project in Yadkin County with Duke University and Duke Energy. Located
                at Loyd Ray Farms, this innovative system reduces greenhouse gas emissions by
                pulling methane from swine waste and using it to generate electricity (or simply
                burning it off). We and our partners received the American Council of Engineering
                Companies' "Grand Conceptor" Award and the 2012 Business Innovator Award from the
                North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association for this project.

              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li>A public-private project in Caldwell County that captures methane gas from the
                Mount Herman landfill to help power the local community. The project generated
                greenhouse gas (GHG) credits that helped offset Google's emissions.

              </ul>
              <p>
                We welcome proposals from data center communities that reduce carbon emissions in
                the immediate region, including projects that increase the renewable energy mix
                powering our data centers. Applicants can be nonprofit or for-profit entrepreneurs.
                We’ll be looking for cost of generation, innovation, and total carbon reduction.
