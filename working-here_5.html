              Tom works on a team responsible for keeping the servers up and running. He focuses on
              diagnosing and fixing any issues that arise within the network. "One of the main
              things I like about my job is the vast amount of new technologies that I work with on

              with the Asian and European data center technicians in the morning to syncing up with
              US data centers in the afternoon and finishing the day with meeting planners in
              Mountain View, Google's headquarters in California."

              As a data center operations technician, John maintains the integrity of the power and

              are going into a work place that has great people that you can have some good 'craic'
              (or enjoyable conversation) with, but you know that they are also extremely competent
              and reliable. This makes the job truly enjoyable."

              machines, Philip manages the team responsible for keeping Google servers up and
              running 24/7. A typical day starts with a team sync on what needs to be done
              throughout the day and includes an afternoon tea break where everyone regroups for
              tea, biscuits, and general catching up. The favorite part of his job? "Getting to
              work with technologies that I never thought I would ever see or get to play
              with—technologies that haven't even reached the market yet."
