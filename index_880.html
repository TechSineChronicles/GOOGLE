              <p>
                At Google, we've spent more than a decade improving the energy efficiency of our
                data centers, and we've picked up some best practices along the way. Whether you're
                running a small or large data center, you can apply several simple design choices
                to improve the efficiency of your facility, reduce costs, and reduce your impact on
                the environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here are our top five best practices:

                    You can't manage what you don’t measure, so be sure to track your data center's
                    energy use. The industry uses a ratio called Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) to
                    measure and help reduce the energy used for non-computing functions like
                    cooling and power distribution. To effectively use PUE, it's important to
                    measure often. We sample at least once per second. It’s even more important to
                    capture energy data over the entire year, since seasonal weather variations
                    affect PUE. <a href=

                    Good air flow management is crucial to efficient data center operation.
                    Minimize hot and cold air mixing by using well-designed containment. Then,
                    eliminate hot spots and be sure to use blanking plates (or flat sheets of
                    metal) for any empty slots in your rack. We've found that a little analysis can
                    have big payoffs. For example, thermal modeling using computational fluid
                    dynamics (CFD) can help you quickly characterize and optimize air flow for your
                    facility without having to reorganize your computing room. <a href=

                    The need to keep data centers at 70°F is a myth. Virtually all equipment
                    manufacturers allow you to run your cold aisle at 80°F or higher. If your
                    facility uses an economizer (which we highly recommend), run elevated cold
                    aisle temperatures to enable more days of "free cooling" and higher energy
                    savings. <a href=

                    Chillers typically use the most energy in a data center's cooling
                    infrastructure, so you'll find the largest opportunity for savings by
                    minimizing their use. Take advantage of "free cooling" to remove heat from your
                    facility without using a chiller. This can include using low temperature
                    ambient air, evaporating water, or a large thermal reservoir. While there's
                    more than one way to free cool, water and air-side economizers are proven and
                    readily available. <a href=

                    You can minimize power distribution losses by eliminating as many power
                    conversion steps as possible. For the conversion steps you must have, be sure
                    to specify efficient equipment transformers and power distribution units
                    (PDUs). One of the largest losses in data center power distribution is from the
                    uninterruptible power supply (UPS), so it's important to select a
                    high-efficiency model. Lastly, keep your high voltages as close to the power
                    supply as possible to reduce line losses. <a href=

                discussion on how we can improve as a whole. In 2013, we hosted the “How green is
                the Internet?” summit to explore questions around the environmental impacts and

                  In 2007, we teamed with Intel and other industry partners to found the Climate
                  Savers Computing Initiative. This non-profit consortium was committed to cutting
                  the energy consumed by computers in half—reducing global CO2 emissions by 54
                  million tons per year. In 2012, Climate Savers Computing Initiative <a href=

                  target="_blank">merged with The Green Grid</a> to create a single, global
                  organization working to address energy efficiency and sustainability issues
                  across the entire computing ecosystem.
