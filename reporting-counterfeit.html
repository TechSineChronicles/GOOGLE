          Reporting Counterfeit
        </h1>
        <p>
          No one wants to get tricked into buying a counterfeit good. Counterfeit goods contain a
          trademark or logo that is identical to or substantially indistinguishable from the
          trademark of another. They mimic the brand features of the product in an attempt to pass
          themselves off as a genuine product of the brand owner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google takes seriously any misuse of our services to advertise or sell counterfeit goods.
          Where Google hosted products or services are used to advertise or sell goods, we have
          clear policies against use for counterfeits. We devote significant engineering and
          machine resources in order to prevent abuse that violates our policies, including
          counterfeiting. However, the vast majority of websites returned in Google Search results
          are third party sites, not Google hosted products or services. If you are concerned with
          content appearing on a site, please contact the site owner directly or if you have
          obtained a court order, consider <a href=
          "https://support.google.com/legal/contact/lr_courtorder?hl=en">our voluntary court order
          process.</a> Check out our <a href="index_398.html">Online Shopping Safety
          Tips</a>, which might help you recognize sites that sell counterfeit products.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also provide consumers and brand owners with forms to report abuse, which can be found
          through individual product's help centers (see all <a href=
          "https://support.google.com/#show-more?hl=en">Google help centers</a>) and include the
