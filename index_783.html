            Renewable energy

          <h2>
            We're promoting cleaner energy for a better future.
          </h2>
          <p>
            Across Google, we're currently using renewable energy to power over 35% of our
            operations. We're <a href="index_579.html" target="_blank">committed to
            using renewable energy</a> like wind and solar as much as possible. So why don't we
            build clean energy sources right on our data centers? Unfortunately, the places with
            the best renewable power potential are generally not the same places where a data
            center can most efficiently and reliably serve its users. While our data centers
            operate 24/7, most renewable energy sources don’t—yet.
          </p>
          <p>
            So we need to plug in to the electricity grid, and the grid isn’t currently very green.
            That's why we're working to green the electricity supply as a whole—not just for us,
            but for everyone.
          </p>
          <h2>
            We've added renewable energy to our communities.
          </h2>
          <p>
            We’ve <a href="index_581.html#purchasing" target="_blank">purchased
            renewable energy</a> from wind farms, adding new clean power near our data centers and
            the communities around us. We found an opportunity in Power Purchase Agreements
            (PPAs)—long-term contracts (typically 20 years) to buy clean energy from a particular
            producer.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we enter into a PPA, we choose projects that add new renewable energy sources to
            the market. By providing developers with a solid commitment, we help them get the money
            they need to finance new clean energy facilities. In exchange, we get clean energy at
            competitive prices as well as the renewable energy certificates (<a href=
            "http://www.epa.gov/greenpower/gpmarket/rec.htm" target="_blank">RECs</a>) to help
            reduce our carbon footprint. Together, we make the grid a little bit greener.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here’s how a PPA works:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>We purchase energy from a renewable project developer.
            </li>
            <li>We then sell that energy right back into the grid at a wholesale price.
            </li>
            <li>We apply the RECs to the non-renewable or "brown" energy used at our data centers.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            We've also <a href=
            "//googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/09/more-renewable-energy-for-our-data.html" target=
            "_blank">partnered with a utility provider</a> to increase the amount of renewable
            energy powering one of our data centers, and with other utility partners to develop
            more <a href="renewable-energy-options.pdf" target=
            "_blank">options</a> for large customers in the state that want to buy renewable
            energy. Until renewable energy is readily and constantly available in the areas where
            we have data centers, we'll continue to find creative ways to supply our data centers
            with clean energy.
          </p>
          <h2>
            We're investing in a brighter future for the whole industry.
          </h2>
          <p>
            We’re going beyond investing in renewable energy for our own operations. We’re also
            <a href="investments.html" target=
            "_blank">investing in renewable energy projects</a> to grow the industry as a whole.
            Specifically, we've made agreements to fund over $1.5 billion in renewable energy
            projects such as large-scale wind and rooftop solar. When added up, these projects
            represent a total capacity of over 2.5 GW, which is far more electricity than we use.
            To put this in context, this electricity is equivalent to that consumed by around
            500,000 homes.

              We purchase clean energy via power purchase agreements, or "PPAs," because they
              create new clean energy now as well as help the renewable energy industry grow in the
              long-term. Learn more about PPAs and why we think they are a valuable solution for
