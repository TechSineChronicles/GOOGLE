            <h3>
              What was Google's carbon footprint in 2013?
            </h3>
            <p>
              In 2013 our net carbon footprint was zero. Before offsets, our gross 2013 carbon
              footprint was 1,766,014 metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub>e including green power purchase
              agreements (Scope 1: 41,373, Scope 2: 1, 245, 253, Scope 3: 479,388) and 2,351,902
              metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub>e excluding green power purchase agreements (Scope 1:
              41,373, Scope 2: 1,831,142, Scope 3: 479,388).
            </p>
            <h3>
              How do you account for green power purchases in your footprint?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Per industry guidance, as of 2012, we deduct our green power purchases from our
              footprint, which accounted for the drop in emission from 2011 to 2012. We've also
              increased our renewable electricity purchases. Starting in 2013, we now report our
              greenhouse gas emission inventory both with and without green power purchase
              agreements.
            </p>
            <h3>
              Why does Carbon Intensity only include only Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Our carbon intensity values include Scope 1 &amp; Scope 2 emissions, where as
              previously, they included Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3. We made this change to be
              consistent with the CDP definition of carbon intensity, which is "Scope 1 and 2
              emissions for the reporting year in metric tonnes CO<sub>2</sub>e per unit currency
              total revenue.

            <h3>
              How do you calculate the percentage of renewables in Google’s total electricity mix?
            </h3>
            <p>
              This calculation includes three components: renewable electricity native to the grid,
              renewable electricity from green power purchase agreements and renewable electricity
              from on-site facilities. To calculate renewable power from the grid, we multiplied
              the electricity consumption of our various offices and data centers around the world
              by the percentage of renewables in that location. For US locations (excluding those
              associated with green power purchase agreements), our grid renewables data are from
              the <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www2.epa.gov/energy/egrid  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by BackStreet browser, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Project.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www2.epa.gov/energy/egrid'" target="_blank">EPA’s eGRID</a>. For
              non-US locations, our grid renewables data are from the <a href=
              "https://www.iea.org/" target="_blank">International Energy Agency</a>. For our green
              power purchase agreements, we assume they are 100% renewable. Similarly, we assume
              our on-site renewable power generation is 100% renewable. We sum these three totals
              and divide them by our total power consumption, including on-site renewables.
            </p>
            <h3>
              What is the impact of Google’s purchases of renewable electricity?
            </h3>
            <p>
              In 2014, Google’s long-term agreements for renewable power produced 1,056,433 MWh.
              These contracts covered 28% of our total electricity consumption. We also obtain
              green power from the grid and on-site renewables, making the total share of
              renewables in our mix over 37%.
            </p>
            <h3>
              What is the impact of Google’s renewable energy project investments?
            </h3>
            <p>
              We have made agreements to fund nearly $2.5 billion in renewable energy projects. The
              total nameplate capacity of all our renewable energy project investments is over 2.9
              GW. These projects are expected to generate over 8.7 billion kWh annually—far more
              electricity than we consume (although we don’t purchase or consume this electricity
              ourselves). To provide context, this electricity is equivalent to that consumed by
              approximately 500,000 homes. This assumes that the average home uses 12,069 kWh per
              year, which comes from the <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www2.epa.gov/energy/power-profiler/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by BackStreet browser, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Project.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www2.epa.gov/energy/power-profiler/'"

              How does Google run its data centers with 50% less energy than a typical data center?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Data centers use energy to run the facility as well as to power the servers that do
              the work. <a href=

              connectors and video cards. We've also efficiently redesigned the components we do
              need, like power supplies, voltage regulators modules and backup power systems.

              How did you calculate the impact of Google’s transportation program?

            <p>
              We used an average commute distance for Googlers, the <a href=

              What assumptions are you using for the "1 month = 1 mile" calculation?
            </h3>
            <p>
              We estimate that Google uses the CO<sub>2</sub>e equivalent of driving one mile to
              serve an active user for one month. To calculate this, we used the following
              assumptions:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Our “active user”—which is not an average user—does 25 searches per day, watches
              60 minutes of YouTube per day and has 1 active Gmail account. We’ve also accounted
              for their use of other Google products and services.
              </li>
              <li>Our carbon intensity is 344 grams of CO<sub>2</sub>e per kWh of energy
              consumption. This is equal to our Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon footprint of 1,512,564
              metric tons CO<sub>2</sub>e divided by our total electricity consumption of 4,402,836
              MWh.
              </li>
              <li>We assumed a fuel economy of 33 miles per gallon, which is the fuel economy of a
              relatively fuel-efficient car, such as a <a href=
              "http://www.ford.com/cars/focus/features/#page=Feature2" target="_blank">Ford
              Focus</a>. We converted this to a carbon emissions intensity using an assumption of

              Do you emit and track biogenic carbon emissions?
            </h3>
            <p>
              We produce and track a small amount (less than 1% of our footprint) of biogenic
              emissions—emissions from biologically based sources like plants, animals or waste.
              These emissions are released via the landfill gas cogeneration facility we operate on
              our Mountain View campus and the biodiesel we use in our shuttles. Biogenic emissions
              are often excluded from an entity's compliance footprint (e.g. these <a href=
              "//www.c2es.org/us-states-regions/action/california/cap-trade-regulation#sub7"
              target="_blank">California regulations</a>) because they are part of the natural
              carbon cycle. The natural carbon cycle takes carbon out of the atmosphere on the
              front end (as opposed to using fossil fuels) and results in emissions that would have
              happened anyway. For example, the landfill gas we use to generate power would have
              otherwise been flared, resulting in the same emissions. Or it would have vented
              directly as methane which would have an even higher greenhouse gas impact. While we
              track our biogenic emissions, we do not include them in our footprint.
