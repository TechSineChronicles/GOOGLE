                Measuring and improving our energy use
              </h2>
              <p>
                We're focused on reducing our energy use while serving the explosive growth of the
                Internet. Most data centers use almost as much non-computing or "overhead" energy
                (like cooling and power conversion) as they do to power their servers. At Google
                we've reduced this overhead to only 12%. That way, most of the energy we use powers
                the machines directly serving Google searches and products. We take detailed
                measurements to continually push toward doing more with less—serving more users
                while wasting less energy.
              </p>
              <h3>
                We take the most comprehensive approach to measuring PUE
              </h3>
              <p>
                Our calculations include the performance of our entire fleet of data centers around
                the world—not just our newest and best facilities. We also continuously measure
                throughout the year—not just during cooler seasons.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, we include all sources of overhead in our efficiency metric. We could
                report much lower numbers if we took the loosest interpretation of the <a href=
                "http://www.thegreengrid.org/Global/Content/Books/Book1-PUEAComprehensiveExaminationoftheMetric"
                target="_blank">Green Grid's PUE measurement standards</a>. In fact, our best site
                could boast a PUE of less than 1.06 if we used an interpretation commonly used in
                the industry. However, we're sticking to a higher standard because we believe it's
                better to measure and optimize everything on our site, not just part of it.
                Therefore, we report a comprehensive trailing twelve-month (TTM) PUE of 1.12 across
                all our data centers, in all seasons, including all sources of overhead.
              </p>

                boundaries.</span>

                Google data center PUE performance
              </h3>
              <p>
                Our fleet-wide PUE has dropped significantly since we first started reporting our
                numbers in 2008. The TTM energy-weighted average PUE for all Google data centers is
                1.12, making our data centers among the most efficient in the world.

                  <p>
                    Our highest TTM PUE was 1.31 at Data Center AF. This facility spent much of the
                    past year with fairly low IT load, so we expect its PUE to improve as it gets
                    closer to its design load. Our highest quarterly PUE was 1.22 at Data Centers I
                    and U. These two facilities are also at relatively low IT load.

                        For Q4, our fleet-wide TTM PUE was 1.12, which has remained constant for
                        the past nine quarters. Our fleet wide quarterly PUE was 1.11, which
                        matches what it was a year ago.

                        Our lowest TTM PUE was 1.09, at Data Center N. Our lowest quarterly PUE was
                        also 1.09, achieved by six facilities.

                        Our highest TTM PUE was 1.13, at Data Centers C, D, E, and H. Our highest
                        quarterly PUE was 1.23 at Data Center U. This facility is not currently
                        supporting a full IT load, and we expect the PUE to improve when the
                        facility runs closer to its design load.

                          For Q1, our quarterly PUE across the fleet was flat from the prior
                          quarter, and remained at 1.11. The corresponding fleet-wide TTM PUE was
                          1.12, which matches what it was a year ago.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          New this quarter is that we have removed Data Center A from reporting.
                          For the past year we have shared that we were moving load out of this
                          site, and in Q1 the load dropped below our 5 MW threshold for reporting.
                          As a result of this change, our maximum site quarterly PUE has dropped
                          from 1.21, which was data center A in Q4 2013, to 1.16, which was data
                          center F in Q1 2014.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          In Q1, we had six data centers reporting quarterly PUE of 1.10 or less,
                          with five coming in at 1.09.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          For TTM site PUE, data centers J, L and N repeated their Q4 performance
                          by producing the lowest TTM PUEs in our fleet, at 1.10.

                          We periodically review our PUE calculations to ensure consistency with
                          The Green Grid guidelines for each site and consistency across sites. In
                          Q4 2013, we updated our PUE formulas for 2013 to include more of our site
                          infrastructure as overhead, which has resulted in many of our PUE values
                          increasing slightly. In addition to mechanical and electrical losses, PUE
                          overhead energy in our PUE calculations includes energy used in
                          substations, transformers, water treatment plants, accessory buildings
                          (such as employee cafeterias and gyms) and office space. Yes, that's more
                          than we've seen anyone include in their PUE. We could strip all this out
                          and have a PUE of 1.06 or less, but we believe it's better to
                          measure--and optimize--all aspects of data center operations. All 2013
                          values have been updated to reflect the new calculations.

                          For our individual site TTM PUE, three sites had 12-month TTM PUE of 1.10
                          or less. Only data center A reported a TTM PUE greater than 1.20.

                          We periodically review our PUE calculations to ensure consistency with
                          The Green Grid guidelines for each site and consistency across sites. In
                          Q4 2013, we updated our PUE formulas for 2013 to include more of our site
                          infrastructure as overhead, which has resulted in many of our PUE values
                          increasing slightly. In addition to mechanical and electrical losses, PUE
                          overhead energy in our PUE calculations includes energy used in
                          substations, transformers, water treatment plants, accessory buildings
                          (such as employee cafeterias and gyms) and office space. Yes, that's more
                          than we've seen anyone include in their PUE. We could strip all this out
                          and have a PUE of 1.06 or less, but we believe it's better to
                          measure--and optimize--all aspects of data center operations. All 2013
                          values have been updated to reflect the new calculations.

                          In Q4, our energy-weighted quarterly PUE dropped .03 to 1.11 from a Q3
                          value of 1.14. This ties with Q1 2012 as our best quarterly
                          energy-weighted PUE value so far. Each of our sites had quarterly PUE
                          values less than 1.20, with five sites reporting quarterly PUE values
                          less than 1.10. For the first time, two of our sites reported PUE values
                          of 1.08.

                          Our individual facility maximum quarterly PUE dropped from 1.25 to 1.19.
                          This drop resulted from our work at Data Center A, where we had been
                          moving IT load out to more efficient facilities over the past few
                          quarters. The PUE at that site initially went up, but once we had moved
                          enough IT load out of that site, we were able to reduce our cooling to
                          better match the remaining IT load—resulting in an overall drop in PUE.

                          Our TTM energy-weighted PUE for Q4 was our best on record at 1.12, which
                          was down .01 from last quarter. All but one of our sites reduced their
                          TTM PUE values in Q4 2012, compared to Q4 2011. Data center J reported a
                          TTM PUE of 1.09, making it our first site to report a TTM PUE less than
                          1.10.

                          In Q3 2012, our fleet-wide quarterly PUE increased by 0.02 from 1.12 to
                          1.14. We expect to see a slight increase in PUE as the weather warms
                          between Q2 and Q3 in the Northern Hemisphere, and the 0.02 Q2-Q3 increase
                          this year is in line with prior year increases. As compared to Q3 2011,
                          all but one of our sites had better quarterly PUE results than they did a
                          year ago.

                          The quarterly PUE at data center J dropped from 1.09 to 1.08 in Q3, which
                          makes it our best performing data center. The TTM PUE for that same data
                          center was 1.10, which was also our best TTM PUE. Ongoing
                          reconfigurations at data center A resulted in our highest quarterly PUE
                          of 1.25.

                          In Q2 2012, our quarterly fleet PUE increased by 0.01 from 1.12 to 1.13.
                          We expect to see a slight increase in PUE as the weather warms between Q1

                          was the smallest increase we've seen. Individually, eight of ten sites
                          had better quarterly PUE results than they did in Q2 2011.

                          is lower than our quarterly fleet PUE of 1.13.

                          center A reported a higher than typical quarterly PUE of 1.23 as we
                          continue to move IT load out of that site to more efficient facilities.

                          In Q1 2012, we posted another best quarterly fleet PUE performance at
                          1.11, down from last quarter's fleet PUE of 1.12. Seven different
                          facilities posted quarterly best results, and four facilities returned
                          quarterly energy-weighted PUEs of less than 1.10.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          We included our twelfth facility, Data Center M, because it meets our PUE
                          reporting criteria. Data Center M posted a quarterly energy-weighted PUE
                          of 1.14, higher than the steady-state design target but inline with
                          expectations due to commissioning activities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Cooling system retrofits at data centers D and E reduced quarterly PUEs
                          from 1.22 and 1.19 last year to 1.14 in Q1 2012. Data Center A reported a
                          higher than typical quarterly PUE of 1.22 due to site work.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Fleet TTM performance also set a new best as our energy-weighted average
                          PUE improved from 1.14 in Q4 to 1.13. Q1 also marked a full year since we
                          added natural gas and office space to our overhead—yet both quarterly and
                          TTM PUEs continue to improve.

                          We posted our best quarterly PUE performance to date at 1.12, down from
                          the previous best of 1.13 in Q1 2010. We accomplished this even after
                          adding two new facilities and even during a quarter with warmer than
                          average temperatures. Data Center F also set a new quarterly best PUE
                          performance for an individual facility at 1.08, improving on the previous
                          best of 1.09 by Data Center E in Q1 2011.

                          As mentioned, this quarter we included two additional facilities in our
                          calculations because they meet our PUE reporting criteria (more than 5MW
                          of critical load and operating for more than 6 months). New Data Centers
                          K and L posted quarterly energy-weighted PUEs of 1.13 and 1.15
                          respectively. New facilities typically result in higher-than-design PUE
                          because of commissioning activities, partial loading, and a lack of
                          operational tuning.

                          Comparing 2011's TTM performance to 2010's, our fleet energy-weighted
                          average PUE improved from 1.16 to 1.14. For individual facilities, Data
                          Centers E, F, and J are all operating with a TTM PUE of 1.11, while only
                          Data Center J operated at a TTM PUE of 1.12 in 2010.

                          Typical warmer summer temperatures increased our fleet's quarterly
                          energy-weighted PUE to 1.16 from 1.14 in Q2. Our quarterly fleet
                          performance showed a significant improvement YoY from 1.20 in Q3 2010 due
                          to less extreme weather and ongoing operational improvements.

                          Weather almost invariably makes Q3 post the highest quarterly

                          quarterly performance of the year (assuming we don't have an abnormal
                          Q4), is the same or better than all but our best quarterly performance in
                          2008, 2009, and the first half of 2010.

                          In Q2 we updated how we calculate PUE to comply with The Green Grid's
                          revised recommendations on measuring and reporting PUE. The change added
                          two new overhead components: natural gas and electricity consumed by data
                          center office space. These changes will have a modest negative impact on
                          PUE. From Q2 onward, we will use the new methodology to report our PUE.
                          However, we will not recalculate Q1 2011 and previous quarters to comply
                          with the new guidelines.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Even with the inclusion of additional overhead terms, the quarterly
                          energy-weighted average PUE was our best Q2 result to date at 1.14. We
                          saw a small increase from 1.13 in Q'11, a strong performance given warmer
                          Q2 temperatures. Quarterly fleet performance improved YoY from 1.17,
                          driven by continued operational improvements, more favorable weather
                          (compared to Q2 2010), and facilities reaching design targets. All but
                          one facility improved YoY PUE for Q2.

                          Our trailing twelve-month energy-weighted average PUE continues to
                          improve with our fleet performance being 1.15, the lowest level since we
                          began reporting PUE data. The TTM energy-weighted PUE has improved every
                          quarter since Q3 2009, and has improved from 1.17 YoY.

                          Our Q1 '11 quarterly energy-weighted average PUE of 1.13 is another
                          excellent fleet performance, matching our best previous in Q4 2010.
                          Typical Q1 seasonal effects kept PUEs low. Data Center E set a new best
                          energy-weighted quarterly PUE to date of 1.09 and Data Center J set a new
                          best TTM PUE of 1.11. Both are excellent performances that are
                          approaching facility design targets.

                          increased quarterly PUEs, in part due to retrofit work being done. All
                          other facilities posted improved PUEs YoY due to continued optimization

                          Our Q4 '10 quarterly energy-weighted average PUE of 1.13 is the best
                          result since we started reporting, beating the PUE of 1.15 in Q1 '10. All
                          but one facility (Data Center C) reported sub-1.20 PUE, and half of the
                          facilities reported PUEs of less than 1.12. Typical seasonal effects were
                          the primary driver for QoQ improvements.

                          The Q4 '10 TTM energy-weighted average PUE also set a new low of 1.16,
                          down from 1.17 in Q3, highlighting steady continuous improvement of the
                          entire fleet. YoY, only one facility (Data Center C), currently
                          undergoing a retrofit, reported a higher PUE in Q4'10 than Q4 '09 â€" all
                          other facilities improved their efficiency. We achieved YoY improvements
                          by improving execution on optimal operational practices and having our
                          facilities operate closer to the design targets.

                          On average, the Q3 wet-bulb temperatures at our facilities were the
                          highest since we started reporting PUE. This weather drove an expected
                          QoQ increase in the total quarterly energy-weighted average PUE to 1.20
                          but the TTM PUE remained flat at 1.18. Even with unfavorable weather, our
                          fleet's quarterly performance improved YoY from 1.22 to 1.20 and the TTM
                          performance improved from 1.19 to 1.18. Data Center J's continued
                          operational tuning resulted in a quarterly (and facility) best PUE at
                          1.12, a strong performance.

                          Typical seasonal effects resulted in a QoQ increase in the total
                          quarterly energy-weighted average PUE to 1.17. On average, the Q2
                          wet-bulb temperatures at our facility locations were higher than those of
                          2009, yet our fleet's quarterly performance improved YoY from 1.20. For
                          the first time Data Center J posted the best quarterly PUE at 1.13 due to
                          improved operations and tuning. The trailing twelve-month energy-weighted
                          average PUE for all facilities remained at 1.18, an improvement from 1.19
                          in Q2 2009. Peak summer weather will likely see an increase in the
                          fleet's quarterly energy-weighted average PUE for Q3.

                          Q1 '10 was the best quarterly fleet performance recorded, with the
                          quarterly energy-weighted average PUE of all facilities falling to 1.15
                          from 1.16 in Q4. All but one facility posted a PUE of 1.2 or less. The
                          improvement was due to the typical seasonal effects and improved
                          operational strategies at Data Centers G, H, I, and J. Data Center E also
                          posted the best quarterly PUE performance from an individual facility to
                          date at 1.10. The trailing twelve-month energy-weighted average PUE
                          improved to 1.18 from 1.19 the same quarter a year ago. We expect higher
                          PUE values in Q2 due to less favorable ambient weather conditions.

                          Seasonal effects and operational improvements enabled QoQ efficiency
                          improvements for all data centers in Q4, reducing the quarterly
                          energy-weighted average PUE of all facilities to 1.16 from 1.22 in Q3.
                          The best quarterly efficiency performance from an individual facility was
                          a PUE of 1.11 (Data Center E), tying our lowest reported value to date
                          (Data Center B, Q1 '09). The trailing twelve-month energy-weighted
                          average PUE improved to 1.19 from 1.20 the same quarter a year ago. The
                          best TTM energy-weighted PUE for an individual facility dropped to 1.13
                          (Data Center B), the lowest TTM PUE to date. Data Centers G, H, I, and J
                          continue to mature operationally, improving their PUE. We expect this
                          trend to continue until they reach the steady state design targets.

                          We added one new facility, Data Center J, to our PUE report. Overall, our
                          fleet QoQ results were as expected. The Q3 total quarterly
                          energy-weighted average PUE of 1.22 was higher than the Q2 result of 1.20
                          due to expected seasonal effects. The trailing twelve-month
                          energy-weighted average PUE remained constant at 1.19. YoY performance
                          improved from facility tuning and continued application of best
                          practices. The quarterly energy-weighted average PUE improved from 1.23
                          in Q3'08, and the TTM PUE improved from 1.21. New data centers G, H, I,
                          and J reported elevated PUE results as we continue to tune operations to
                          meet steady-state design targets.

                          This quarter three new data centers (G,H, and I) met inclusion criteria,
                          bringing the total number of conforming facilities to nine. The PUE of
                          the new facilities is elevated due to commissioning and bring-up
                          activities. The combined impact of partially-commissioned facilities and
                          traditional seasonal effects resulted in a QoQ increase of our quarterly
                          energy-weighted average PUE, bringing it to 1.20. The TTM energy-weighted
                          average PUE for all conforming facilities, however, remained at 1.19,
                          despite warmer temperatures. This result is due to continued YoY
                          operational improvements for Google's fully commissioned data centers.
                          Both the minimum and maximum individual facility TTM PUE results
                          decreased in this quarter as a result of operational improvements.

                          The efficiency of all data centers again improved QoQ due to further
                          optimization and cooler temperatures. The quarterly energy-weighted
                          average PUE dropped to 1.15 from 1.16 in Q4, and the quarterly PUE values
                          for each data center was less than or equal to 1.20. The collective TTM
                          energy-weighted average PUE fell to 1.19 from 1.20. The best-performing
                          individual facility quarterly PUE dropped to 1.11 (Data Center F) from
                          1.13 in Q4 (Data Center E). Data Center F had the highest PUE in Q3 '08
                          due to a low IT load and incomplete commissioning activity at that time.
                          Data Center A yielded YoY reductions due to completed cooling plant
                          improvements. Data Centers C and D improved YoY because of increased IT
                          load, which better utilized the cooling plant resources.

                          Efficiency of all data centers improved QoQ due to continued optimization
                          and cooler temperatures. The quarterly energy-weighted average PUE
                          dropped to 1.16 from 1.22 in Q3 while the collective TTM energy-weighted
                          average PUE fell to 1.20 from 1.21. The best performing individual
                          facility quarterly PUE dropped to 1.13 (Data Centers E, F) from 1.17 in
                          Q3 (Data Center B). All facilities made YoY efficiency improvements, with
                          Data Center A showing strong results from cooling plant improvements
                          designed to improve free cooling.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Data Centers E and F moved through commissioning and into full operation,
                          both yielding an excellent quarterly PUE score of 1.13 and 1.14,
                          respectively. Looking back, Figure 2 shows the large daily variations and
                          higher PUE quieting to an expected lower value.During commissioning, at
                          times all chillers and air movers were run simultaneously in order to
                          test proper operation of the facility. Concurrently, IT equipment load
                          was small because the facility was in the early stages of deployment.
                          These factors caused the higher Q3'08 average PUE values as well as
                          significant day-to-day variations. Q4'08 saw these commissioning
                          activities taper off, and the favorable seasonal conditions led to lower,
                          stable PUE values.

              </h3>
              <h4>
                What's the average PUE of other data centers?
              </h4>
              <p>
                According to the Uptime Institute's 2014 Data Center Survey, the global average of
                respondents' largest data centers is around 1.7.
              </p>
              <h4>
                Why does our data vary?
              </h4>
              <p>
                Our facilities have different power and cooling infrastructures, and are located in
                different climates. Seasonal weather patterns also impact PUE values, which is why
                they tend to be lower during cooler quarters. We've managed to maintain a low PUE
                average across our entire fleet of data center sites around the world—even during
                hot, humid <a href="about/datacenters/locations/douglas-county/">Atlanta
                summers</a>.
              </p>
              <h4>
                How do we get our PUE data?
              </h4>
              <p>
                We use multiple on-line power meters in our data centers to measure power
                consumption over time. We track the energy used by our cooling infrastructure and
                IT equipment on separate meters, giving us very accurate PUE calculations. We
                account for all of our power-consuming elements in our PUE by using dozens or even
                hundreds of power meters in our facilities.
              </p>
              <h4>
                What do we include in our calculations?
              </h4>
              <p>
                When measuring our IT equipment power, we include only the servers, storage, and
                networking equipment. We consider everything else overhead power. For example, we
                include electrical losses from a server's power cord as overhead, not as IT power.
                Similarly, we measure total utility power at the utility side of the substation,
                and therefore include substation transformer losses in our PUE.

                The data center industry uses the measurement PUE, or power usage effectiveness, to
                measure efficiency. A PUE of 2.0 means that for every watt of IT power, an
                additional watt is consumed to cool and distribute power to the IT equipment. A PUE
                closer to 1.0 means nearly all of the energy is used for computing.

              Building custom, highly-efficient servers
            </h2>
            <p>
              Google's servers are high-performance computers that run all the time. They're the
              core of our data centers, and we've designed them to use as little energy as
              possible. We do this by minimizing power loss and by removing unnecessary parts. We
              also ensure our servers use little energy when they're waiting for a task, rather
              than hogging power when there’s less computing work to be done.
            </p>
            <h3>
              We optimize the power path.
            </h3>
            <p>
              A typical server wastes up to a third of the energy it uses before any of that energy
              reaches the parts that do the actual computing. Servers lose the most energy at the
              power supply, which converts the AC voltage coming from a standard outlet to a set of
              low DC voltages. They then lose more at the voltage regulator, which further converts
              the power supply's output to the voltages required by microchips. Designed with low
              efficiency standards in order to save on initial cost, traditional servers end up
              costing much more in electricity in the long run.
            </p>
            <p>
              Google servers are different. Since 2001, we've been designing them to be more
              efficient. For many years now, we've used very efficient power supplies. Similarly,
              we use highly efficient voltage regulator modules to ensure that most of the power
              goes to the components that do the actual computing work. We’ve cut out two of the
              AC/DC conversion stages by putting back-up batteries directly on the server racks. We
              estimate an annual savings of over 500 kWh per server—or 25%—over a typical system.
            </p>
            <h3>
              We customize our servers to stick with the essentials.
            </h3>
            <p>
              When it comes to hardware, we only use what's necessary for our applications to run.
              We remove unnecessary components like peripheral connectors and video cards. We also
              optimize our servers and racks to use minimal fan power. The fans spin just fast
              enough to keep our machines cool enough to run.
            </p>
            <p>
              We encourage all of our suppliers to produce parts that operate efficiently whether
              they’re idle, operating at full capacity, or at lower usage levels—an idea we
              introduced as "energy proportionality" in 2007. Our <a href=
              "http://research.google.com/pubs/pub33387.html" target="_blank">study</a> shows that
              more energy-proportional systems can cut total energy use in half at large data
              centers.

              Controlling the temperature of our equipment
            </h2>
            <p>
              To help our equipment function optimally while continuing to save energy, we manage
              the temperature and airflow in our data centers and machines in simple,
              cost-effective ways.
            </p>
            <h3>
              We raise the thermostat to 80°F.
            </h3>
            <p>
              One of the simplest ways to save energy in a data center is to raise the temperature.
              It’s a myth that data centers need to be kept chilly. According to <a href=
              "http://www.ashrae.org/" target="_blank">expert</a> recommendations and most IT
              equipment manufacturers' specifications, data center operators can safely raise their
              cold aisle to 80°F or higher. By doing so, we significantly reduce facility energy
              use.
            </p>
            <h3>
              We plan by using thermal modeling.
            </h3>
            <p>
              We use thermal modeling to locate “hot spots” and better understand airflow in the
              data center. In the design phase, we physically arrange our equipment to even out
              temperatures in the facility. Even after that, we can move certain equipment like
              computer room air conditioners (CRACs) to reduce hot spots and even out the ambient
              temperature—ultimately reducing the amount of time the CRAC must run.
            </p>
            <h3>
              We find inexpensive ways to manage airflow.
            </h3>
            <p>
              To cut cooling costs and save energy, we prevent the “hot aisle” air behind the
              server racks from mixing with the “cold aisle” in front of the server racks. In our
              large data centers, we use appropriate ducting and permanent enclosures. In addition,
              we take simple measures well-suited for smaller “closet” style data centers. For
              instance, we:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Use blanking panels (or flat sheets of metal) to close off empty rack slots and
              prevent hot aisle air from seeping into to the cold aisle.
              </li>
              <li>Hang plastic curtains (like those used in commercial refrigerators) to seal off
              the cold aisle.
              </li>
              <li>Enclose areas with components that run hotter (such as power supply units or
              PSUs) with plastic curtains.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              These efforts help to reduce the total amount of energy used for cooling. At the same
              time, they ensure that the cooler air we send into the cold aisles is truly cool
              enough to do its job.

              Cooling with water—not chillers
            </h2>
            <p>
              The electricity that powers a data center ultimately turns into heat. Most data
              centers use chillers or air conditioning units to cool things down, requiring 30-70%
              overhead in energy usage. At Google data centers, we often use water as an
              energy-efficient way to cool instead.
            </p>
            <h3>
              We trap hot air and cool our equipment with water.
            </h3>We've designed custom cooling systems for our server racks that we've named
            “<a href=
            "http://googlegreenblog.blogspot.com/2012/10/cooling-cloud-look-inside-googles-hot.html"
            target="_blank">Hot Huts</a>” because they serve as temporary homes for the hot air
            that leaves our servers—sealing it away from the rest of the data center floor. Fans on
            top of each Hot Hut unit pull hot air from behind the servers through water-cooled
            coils. The chilled air leaving the Hot Hut returns to the ambient air in the data
            center, where our servers can draw the chilled air in, cooling them down and completing
            the cycle.
            <h3>
              We take advantage of evaporative cooling.
            </h3>
            <p>
              Evaporation is a powerful tool. In our bodies, it helps us maintain our temperature
              even when outside temperatures are warmer than we are. It also works similarly in our
              <a href=
              "http://googlegreenblog.blogspot.com/2012/11/getting-heat-out-look-at-evaporative.html"
              target="_blank">cooling towers</a>. As hot water from the data center flows down the
              towers through a material that speeds evaporation, some of the water turns to vapor.
              A fan lifts this vapor, removing the excess heat in the process, and the tower sends
              the cooled water back into the data center.
            </p>

              We use the natural cooling power of sea water.

              to cool without chillers</a>. We chose this location for its cold climate and its
              location on the Gulf of Finland. The cooling system we designed pumps cold water from
              the sea to the facility, transfers heat from our operations to the sea water through
              a heat exchanger, and then cools this water before returning it to the gulf. Because
              this approach provides all of our needed cooling year round, we haven't had to
              install any mechanical chillers at all.
            </p>
            <h3>
              We save and recycle water.
            </h3>
            <p>
              To better conserve water, we power two of our data centers with 100% recycled water,
              and capture rainwater for cooling a third. The idea is simple: instead of using
              potable (or drinking) water for cooling, we use non-drinkable sources of water and
              clean it just enough so we can use it for cooling.
            </p>
            <p>
              We use recycled water from various sources. Our Douglas County facility <a href=
              "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJnlgM1yEU0" target="_blank">treats city waste
              water</a>, while our Belgium facility pulls water from an industrial canal. There, we
              use a large tank filled with fine sand to filter out small particles, leaving the
              water completely clear (although not suitable for drinking). While it's not always
              possible or cost-effective to use recycled water, we're optimistic that we can find
              sustainable solutions for the majority of our water use.

              From the moment we decide to purchase a piece of equipment to the moment we retire

            <p>
              Whenever possible, we use local vendors for heavier components like our server racks.
              Even if material is more expensive locally, we can recoup the extra cost by reducing
              shipping charges from farther locations where the material may be cheaper. By
              limiting the shipping distance, we reduce the environmental impact of transportation.

              We reuse existing machines
            </h3>
            <p>
              Before we buy new equipment and materials, we look for ways to reuse what we already
              have. As we upgrade to newer, higher-speed servers, we repurpose older machines
              either by moving them to services that don’t require as much processing power, or by
              removing and reusing the components that are still in good working condition.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since 2007, we've remanufactured and repurposed enough outdated servers to avoid
              buying over 300,000 new replacement machines.

              At each location, we maximize the recycling of all our data center material. When we
              can’t repurpose our equipment, we completely erase any components that stored data,
              and then resell them into the market, giving this equipment a second life. We break
              down any components that can’t be sold into raw materials like copper, steel,
              aluminum, and plastics for responsible recycling.
