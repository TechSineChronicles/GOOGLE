                We commute sustainably
              </h2>
              <p>
                We’ve built a green transportation system that includes biodiesel shuttles and the
                largest corporate electric vehicle charging infrastructure in the country. Every
                day, our shuttles keep thousands of Googlers out of the driver's seat and reduce
                our impact on the environment. And GFleet—our car-sharing program for Googlers on
                campus—includes the newest generation of plug-in vehicles. We’re trying to tackle
                every possible reason our employees might drive a gas-fueled car to work.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our shuttles and GFleet result in net annual savings of more than 29,000 metric
                tons of CO2. That’s like taking about 5,700 cars off the road or avoiding 87
                million vehicle miles every year!

                High-tech, low-impact employee shuttles
              </h3>
              <p>
                Because the shuttle system that serves commuters to our San Francisco Bay Area
                offices is so convenient and rider-friendly, Googlers often leave their cars at
                home (or don't own cars at all). About 6,400 Googlers take the shuttle to work on
                any given day, and our shuttle program hit 2.5 million rides in 2013.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to an ultra comfortable ride, real-time location information, and wifi,
                our shuttles have the cleanest diesel engines ever built. In fact, Google is the
                first and largest company with a corporate coach fleet to exceed the EPA's 2010 bus
                emission standards. They run on 5% biodiesel and are fitted with filtration systems
                that eliminate many harmful emissions, including nitrogen oxide.

              </h3>
              <p>
                Over the last several years, as new electric vehicle (EV) and plug-in hybrid
                technologies have arrived on the market, we've worked to build one of the most
                advanced corporate car sharing programs in the country at our Mountain View
                headquarters. This program, called the GFleet, serves two purposes. First, it
                provides Googlers with a low-carbon transportation option once they get to the
                office using alternative transportation (for instance, the Google shuttle, walking,
                biking, or carpooling). Second, we like to invest in promising, new, sustainable
                technologies and pilot them wherever possible on our campuses.
              </p>
              <p>
                The GFleet is made up of Chevrolet Volts, Nissan LEAFs, Mitsubishi iMiEVs, Ford
                Focus Electrics, and a Honda Fit EV. Googlers have driven our fleet of electric
                vehicles more than 1,500,000 miles, and we’ll continue adding models from other
                manufacturers as they become available. To juice up our GFleet cars, provide more
                charging options for EV-driving Googlers, and encourage more Googlers to make the
                switch to EVs, we've partnered with <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.coulombtech.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by BackStreet browser, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Project.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.coulombtech.com/'" target=

                Hundreds of Googlers around the world get to work by foot, bike, unicycle,
                skateboard, scooter, and even kayak. Cycling to work is one mode of transportation
                we strongly encourage. This year, over 3,700 Googlers in 26 offices participated in
                the Google Bike to Work Day, our way of celebrating cycling commuters and
                introducing new riders to this transport option.

              </h3>
              <p>
                Every day, Googlers around the world enjoy a variety of healthy, flavorful and
                seasonal food for free. While we don't have a one-size-fits-all approach across our
                locations, we strive to build sustainability into each aspect of our food program.
              </p>
              <p>
                Across all of our cafes worldwide, we are building partnerships that support
                responsible business practices. We take time to get to know our suppliers—how they
                raise, farm, and harvest their food. For example, in Northern California we partner
                with a range of farms and suppliers. We purchase local, organic dairy from Clover
                Stornetta Farms in Sonoma County. We partner with local farms, like Alba Organics
                and Pie Ranch, who are working to educate aspiring farmers and consumers on
                responsible farming methods. We also partner with Driscolls, a very large berry
                producer who brings organic methods to conventional farming, and Kingsburg
                Orchards, a stone fruit farmer who uses integrated pest management practices.
                Additionally, Googlers enjoy a great cup of coffee, so we purchase only from
                roasters who offer clear traceability into where their beans come from and how they
                are grown.
              </p>
              <p>
                These are just a few examples of what we do at our headquarters in Northern
                California. We work hard to bring the same responsible sourcing practices
                everywhere we operate around the world.

              <p>
                The oceans are one of our greatest resources, covering more than 70% of the world's
                surface. They are the original source of most of our food chain, and protecting the
                ocean ecosystem is therefore a critical environmental priority. At Google, we’re
                committed to serving sustainable seafood from local, fresh, and seasonal sources.
                We also source from responsibly-managed aquaculture or wild-capture fisheries. Our
                detailed seafood policy focuses on the source, the ways fish are caught, and
                species of fish that we serve in our cafes. This allows us to serve fresher,
                tastier seafood while supporting a sustainable food system.

                With all the effort we put into food procurement, we want to be thoughtful about

                  <strong>Data-driven purchasing:</strong> We analyze what's popular in our cafes
                  plus what's in season to determine the right quantities of ingredients to buy.
                  This helps us eliminate waste and ensure we’re providing a healthy, diverse
                  offering at every meal.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Using real dishes and silverware:</strong> In our cafes, employees
                  generally use non-disposable dishes and flatware. If they need to eat at their
                  desks, they can leave dishes to be cleaned in any of the nearby micro-kitchens.
                  This practice cuts down substantially on our use of disposable products.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Composting and recycling</strong>: Throughout our campuses are clearly
                  marked recycling and composting bins, and any grab-and-go containers and flatware
                  that are used are compostable. 20% of Google cafe waste is recycled, and the rest
                  is composted.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Donating unused food:</strong> Any untouched, edible food is sent to
                  local shelters and food banks in our communities.

                Eliminating toxics through Google’s Healthy Materials Program
              </h3>
              <p>
                We believe that a healthy work environment and a sustainable world begin with
                transparency and cooperation. A surprising number of chemicals of concern have been
                incorporated into commonly used building materials without being assessed for their
                impact on human health. We’ve eliminated many of these chemicals in our buildings.
                We actively seek sustainable materials that are locally manufactured, high in
                recycled content, and biodegradable.
              </p>
              <p>
                At Google’s offices worldwide, we put all building materials and products through a
                rigorous screening process to determine which adhere to our healthy building
                standards—and we purchase the products that best meet our stringent criteria.

              </h3>
              <p>
                Our focus on creating healthy environments doesn’t stop with the building materials
                in our offices. We make every effort to address the factors that impact people’s
                experience of indoor environments, such as thermal comfort, daylight and access to
                views. We also provide aggressive performance benchmarks for energy and water
                consumption. We use sophisticated building control technologies to ensure systems
                are on only when we need them. We’ve installed solar electric and solar hot water
                panels on our roofs, treated water on-site for reuse, and used recycled municipal
                wastewater for other applications (e.g. toilet flushing and landscape watering). We
                have the aspirational goal of diverting 99% of construction waste from our
                projects.

              </h3>
              <p>
                In order to set goals and benchmark building performance, we often use proven
                industry frameworks such as the US Green Building Council’s <a href=
                "http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=1988" target="_blank">Leadership
                in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)</a> certification program and the Living
                Building Challenge. We’ve also created an internal program known as “Sustainable
                Pursuit” (based on the popular <a href="index_222.html#q=trivial+pursuit"
                target="_blank">trivia</a> game and the LEED framework) to measure and improve how
                we operate our buildings.
              </p>

                Teams at Google offices around the world compete for points depending on their
                site’s sustainable initiatives. Through this program, our Real Estate &amp;
                Workplace Services Green Team works closely with facility managers at Google
                offices worldwide to implement innovative, locally-appropriate strategies to reduce
                waste, save energy and water, and improve indoor environmental quality. We also
                make it a priority to document and share team innovations so that organizational
                knowledge is spread across all Google teams.
              </p>
              <p>
                Highlights of our efforts include the following:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Solar power and advanced building controls in Mountain View,
                  California:</strong> Our 1.9 MW solar installation supplies approximately 30% of
                  our peak energy consumption on the buildings it covers, and we’ve implemented a
                  building management system that monitors and controls campus-wide energy use.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Reducing water usage in light of California drought:</strong> When the
                  drought started, we had already been participating with the California Best
                  Building Challenge, targeting 20% reductions on already high performing buildings
                  in energy, water and waste. We undertook a huge effort to convert our landscape
                  irrigation to recycled municipal water (purple pipe), saving an estimated 24
                  million gallons of potable water for the year. We’ve also been replacing
                  water-intensive turf with drought-friendly native landscaping all over campus, as
                  well as replacing showerheads and faucets in favor of low-flow ones. In light of
                  the drought, we've upped the ante to a 30% reduction. We’re also on track for the
                  20% reductions in waste and energy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Water recycling in Hyderabad, Sydney and New York:</strong> In Hyderabad,
                  roughly 380,000 gallons of wastewater are treated and reused annually in
                  non-potable systems (e.g. flushing toilets and landscaping). Similarly, our
                  Sydney office (recently <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.gbca.org.au/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by BackStreet browser, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Project.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.gbca.org.au/'" target="_blank">Green
                  Star certified</a> by the Green Building Council of Australia) treats and
                  recycles waste water for toilet flushing and landscape irrigation. The New York
                  office installed a system to capture and use groundwater that was being pumped
                  into the sewer system since the building opened in 1932, replacing 20%-60% of
                  potable cooling-tower water.

                <li>
                  <strong>Reducing energy use in New York City:</strong> We are participating in
                  the Mayor’s Carbon Challenge and have reduced the carbon footprint of the office
                  by more than 15% in the first year of the challenge. More projects are on the way
                  to further reduce energy usage, including chiller upgrades, lighting controls and
                  wall insulation. We are also currently installing what will be some of the
                  highest thermal-performing windows in the world.

                <li>
                  <strong>Efficient heating and cooling In Zurich, Switzerland:</strong> A chilled
                  beam heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) system uses significantly less
                  energy to regulate building temperature while also occupying less space than
                  conventional equipment.

                <li>
                  <strong>Rainwater harvesting system in Dublin, Ireland:</strong> A rainwater
                  harvesting unit collects, filters, and treats rainwater to be used for toilet
                  flushing for the bathrooms in the building. It is estimated to gather 157,350
                  gallons annually (25% of the water demand) at our Dublin office.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Urban agriculture across offices:</strong> Several Google offices,
                  including New York, Pittsburgh and Mountain View, have taken up urban
                  agriculture. Several have small gardens that supply fresh greens to the onsite
                  cafes. Some even allow Googlers to pick their salad straight from the plant to
                  reinforce where the food comes from. New York and Pittsburgh also host beehives
                  that help pollinate the gardens and provide honey for the cafes, not to mention
                  fighting the disappearance of honeybees by maintaining strong, managed hives.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>LEED certification of our buildings globally:</strong> We have over 4
                  million square feet of LEED certified buildings, 1.2 million of which is Platinum
                  (highest level possible) and 2.6 million Gold, with more in the works. We also
                  have one Green Star certification (Australia’s LEED equivalent). Our office in
                  Dublin achieved Ireland’s first Platinum certification and our Buenos Aires
                  office achieved the first LEED certification in Argentina.
